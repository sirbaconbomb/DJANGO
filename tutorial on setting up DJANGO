First you'll have to make sure that python is installed on your computer so type in:
python --version into your command line
if you aren't sure how to get to your command line then go to your computer search and type in CMD which should give you the option

now you'll have to create a virtual environment for django so that you don't have to worry about any dependencies.  
THIS WILL ALSO BE DONE ON THE COMMAND LINE.  I've typed below your step by step commands to install for windows:

1. python -m pip install -U pip
2. pip install virtualenv

NOW CREATE A NAME FOR YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

1. virtualenv virtenv_site1 ...this can be whatever you want really

enter your new directory
2. cd virtenv_site1

check out what files are in it
3. dir

enter the scripts folder
4. cd Scripts

run the activate EXE
5. activate

install django
6. pip install django
7. python
8. import django
9. django.get_version()

make sure to type the () at the end of your installation
10. quit()

enter your sample site and start your project
11. cd ..
12. django-admin startproject sampsite
13. cd sampsite

RUN YOUR SAMPLE DJANGO SERVER
14. python manage.py runserver

YOU'RE DONE...you now have django installed
